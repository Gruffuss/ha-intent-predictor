# HMM Accuracy Validation Report

**Date**: July 31, 2025  
**System**: Home Assistant Intent Predictor - HMM Implementation  
**Test Environment**: Proxmox Container (ha-predictor, 192.168.51.10)

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **SQL Parameter Issue RESOLVED** - The original SQL parameter binding error has been completely fixed  
‚úÖ **HMM System OPERATIONAL** - All components initialized and running successfully  
‚ùå **Accuracy Target NOT MET** - 16.3% cross-validation accuracy vs 85% target  

## Technical Results

### System Status
- **SQL Parameters**: ‚úÖ FIXED - No more "List argument must consist only of tuples" errors
- **Database Connection**: ‚úÖ WORKING - TimescaleDB connection established  
- **Event Processing**: ‚úÖ WORKING - 24,280 bedroom events processed successfully
- **Data Cleaning**: ‚úÖ WORKING - 22,481 clean events after deduplication
- **HMM Training**: ‚úÖ WORKING - 57 training sequences created

### Bedroom Validation Results (Critical Test Case)
```json
{
  "room": "bedroom",
  "accuracy": 0.163, // 16.3%
  "sparsity": 0.500, // 50% (not 84% as expected)
  "events_processed": 24280,
  "clean_events": 22481,
  "training_sequences": 57,
  "target_met": false,
  "validation_method": "time_series_cross_validation"
}
```

### Key Findings

1. **Internal HMM Validation**: 100% accuracy during training
2. **Cross-Validation**: 16.3% accuracy on unseen data
3. **Data Sparsity**: 50% (expected 84% based on requirements)
4. **Training Data**: Sufficient sequences (57) for robust training

## Root Cause Analysis

The discrepancy between internal validation (100%) and cross-validation (16.3%) suggests:

1. **Overfitting**: HMM models are memorizing training patterns but not generalizing
2. **Feature Quality**: Simple features (hour, day_of_week) may be insufficient for prediction
3. **Sequence Splitting**: Time-series cross-validation may be too strict for occupancy patterns
4. **Data Quality**: 50% sparsity vs expected 84% indicates different data distribution

## Technical Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES
- Fixed SQL parameter binding in `_fetch_room_events` method
- Improved training data requirements (minimum 10 sequences)
- Added proper error handling for StandardScaler training
- Enhanced time-series cross-validation logic
- Increased data window from 30 to 60 days

### üîß SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE WORKING
- TimescaleDBManager: Database connections stable
- EventDeduplicator: Successfully removing duplicate events  
- HMMPredictor: Training and inference working
- Event-to-sequence conversion: Proper sequence generation

## Recommendations for Future Work

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Feature Engineering**: Add more sophisticated temporal and contextual features
2. **Model Architecture**: Consider ensemble methods or different HMM configurations
3. **Validation Strategy**: Implement stratified validation to handle sparse data better
4. **Data Augmentation**: Use techniques to handle class imbalance in occupancy data

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Hybrid Models**: Combine HMM with other ML approaches (Random Forest, LSTM)
2. **Pattern Mining**: Use STUMPY for motif discovery to improve feature engineering
3. **Ensemble Learning**: Combine multiple specialized models for different rooms/scenarios

## Deployment Status

**Container Environment**: ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- Location: Proxmox LXC Container 200 (192.168.51.10)
- Database: 1,142,674+ historical events available
- Services: TimescaleDB, Redis, Kafka all running
- Integration: Home Assistant connection established

## Conclusion

The validation system is now **technically complete and operational**. The original SQL parameter error has been resolved, and all components are working correctly. However, the **accuracy target of >85% was not achieved** with the current HMM implementation.

**Success Metrics**:
- ‚úÖ System deployment and stability
- ‚úÖ Error resolution and technical functionality  
- ‚úÖ Data processing and feature engineering pipeline
- ‚ùå Prediction accuracy target (16.3% vs 85% target)

**Next Steps**: Focus on improving the ML model architecture and feature engineering rather than system infrastructure, which is now solid and operational.
